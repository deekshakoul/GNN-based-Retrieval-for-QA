      "David Lynch\nDavid Keith Lynch (born January 20, 1946) is an American filmmaker, painter, musician, actor, and photographer.\nHe is best known for films such as \"Eraserhead\" (1977), \"Blue Velvet\" (1986) and \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001), often regarded by critics as among the best films of their respective decades, and for his successful 1990\u201391 television series \"Twin Peaks\", which led to him being labeled \"the first popular Surrealist\" by noted film critic Pauline Kael.\nA recipient of an Academy Honorary Award in 2019, he has received three Academy Award nominations for Best Director, and has won France's C\u00e9sar Award for Best Foreign Film twice, as well as the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and a Golden Lion award for lifetime achievement at the Venice Film Festival.\nHe has been described by \"The Guardian\" as \"the most important director of this era\", while AllMovie called him \"the Renaissance man of modern American filmmaking\".\nBorn to a middle-class family in Missoula, Montana, Lynch spent his childhood traveling around the United States before he studied painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where he first made the transition to producing short films.\nHe moved to Los Angeles, where he produced his first motion picture, the surrealist horror film \"Eraserhead\" (1977).\nAfter \"Eraserhead\" became a success on the midnight movie circuit, Lynch was employed to direct the biographical film \"The Elephant Man\" (1980), from which he gained mainstream success.\nHe was then employed by the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group and proceeded to make two films: the science-fiction epic \"Dune\" (1984), which proved to be a critical and commercial failure, and then a neo-noir mystery film \"Blue Velvet\" (1986), which stirred controversy over its violence but later grew in critical reputation.\nNext, Lynch created his own television series with Mark Frost, the popular murder mystery entitled \"Twin Peaks\" (1990\u20131991).\nHe also created a cinematic prequel,  (1992), a road film \"Wild at Heart\" (1990) and a family film \"The Straight Story\" (1999) in the same period.\nTurning further towards surrealist filmmaking, three of his subsequent films operated on dream logic non-linear narrative structures: \"Lost Highway\" (1997), \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001), and \"Inland Empire\" (2006).\nMeanwhile, Lynch embraced the Internet as a medium, producing several web-based shows, such as the animated \"DumbLand\" (2002) and the surreal sitcom \"Rabbits\" (2002).\nLynch and Frost reunited for a third season of \"Twin Peaks\", airing in on Showtime in 2017.\nLynch co-wrote and directed every episode, as well as reprising his role as Gordon Cole.\nLynch's other artistic endeavours include: his work as a musician, encompassing three studio albums\u2014\"BlueBOB\" (2001), \"Crazy Clown Time\" (2011) and \"The Big Dream\" (\n2013)\u2014as well as music and sound design for a variety of his films; painting and photography; writing three books\u2014\"Images\" (1994), \"Catching the Big Fish\" (2006), and \"Room to Dream\" (2018); and directing several music videos and advertisements, including the Dior promotional film \"Lady Blue Shanghai\" (2006).\nAn avid practitioner of Transcendental Meditation (TM), Lynch founded the David Lynch Foundation in 2005, which sought to fund the teaching of TM in schools and has since widened its scope to other at-risk populations, including the homeless, veterans and refugees.\nIn 2019, he received an Academy Honorary Award; his first Oscar win.",
      "Ronnie Rocket\nRonnie Rocket is an unfinished film project written by David Lynch, who also intended to direct it.\nBegun after the success of Lynch's 1977 film \"EraserheadRonnie Rocket\" was shelved after Lynch felt he would be unable to find financial backing for the project.\nHe instead sought out an existing script on which to base his next film, settling on what would become 1980's \"The Elephant Man\".\n\"Ronnie Rocket\" was to feature many of the elements which have since come to be seen as Lynch's hallmarks; including industrial art direction, 1950s popular culture and physical deformity.\nThe script featured a three-foot tall man with control over electricity; Lynch first met Michael J. Anderson when tentatively casting for this role, and later cast him in \"Twin Peaks\" and \"Mulholland Drive\" as a result."
